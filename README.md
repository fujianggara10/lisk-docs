# Lisk Docs

This repository contains the Lisk documentation, accessible at <https://docs.lisk.com>.
It tracks and maintains all updates and new content related to the documentation.
The documentation for Lisk is generated using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) as the site generator.

## Set up docs locally

1. Clone the `lisk-docs` repository to your computer.

2. Install all the dependencies by executing the following:

    ```
    yarn install
    ```

3. To run a local instance of docs, execute:

    ```
    yarn start
    ```

    This command starts a local development server and opens a browser window at <http://localhost:3000/>.
    Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build & Serve

It is essential to test your `build` & `serve` it locally before submitting it for review.

### Build

To build the docs, execute the following:

```
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static content hosting service.

### Serve

Docusaurus provides a [serve](https://docusaurus.io/docs/cli#docusaurus-serve-sitedir) command to deploy your built files locally:

```
yarn serve
```

By default, this will load your site at <http://localhost:3000/>.
You'll have to build and serve again if any changes are made.

### Translation Tracker

The following table lists all the recently created/updated pull requests for the English version.

If you attempt to translate any of the following documents, please note that each PR's corresponding locale files should be updated according to the language.
If a new file is created in the English version and does not exist in the translated docs folder, i.e., `i18n/`, then create a new file in the same directory inside the `i18n/` parent folder and name it exactly as it is in the English version.

Once translated, the PR entry in the following table should be removed, and the translation PR should be submitted for review.
